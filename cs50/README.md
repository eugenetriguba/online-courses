CS50 C Library is used throughout some of these programs. If you want to learn more or need the install instructions, 
go to [manual.cs50.net/library](https://manual.cs50.net/library/).

To compile a program using the CS50 library:
```
$ gcc file.c -o file -lcs50
```

Alternatively, you can use the CS50 IDE on Cloud9 at [ide.cs50.io](https://ide.cs50.io) and clone down the repo from there 
to be in the same enviroment.
